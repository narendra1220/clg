          <p>Cyber security, as a profession is the evolving and pressing field inferable from the regularly increasing cyber attacks. Any industry that transacts online and carries sensitive data is in need of a cyber security professional today. Cyber security jobs are in high demand and it doesn’t seem like the need for more security professionals is going anywhere in the foreseeable future. Cyber attacks are only becoming more common and more harmful, and even though we tend to only hear about the attacks of high-profile entities, no company — or individual for that matter — with an online presence is immune to attacks. The future of cyber security is tightly connected to the future of information technology and the advancements of the cyberspace. Connected cars will make our daily commute easier, and virtually all of our personal data will reside in cloud computing, where we don’t fully control the data flow and access to information.</p>
